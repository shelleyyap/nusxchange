          <p align="justify">This web application is an Orbital project by team P.O.P, which consists of two members, Chua Ka Yi Ong and Yap Ying Ying. It gives NUS students detailed information regarding available exchange programmes. We hope that collating reviews by students who have gone on SEP will allow students to make more informed choices.<br/></p>
